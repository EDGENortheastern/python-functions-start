Python functions starter

# Python  excercise files:

To run the project locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repo to your local, e.g.,

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EDGENortheastern/python-functions-start.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install Pytest

```bash
pip3 install pytest
```

5. Run the tests

```bash
pytest #run tests
```

## Overall goal is to write the functions to pass the tests. This is the solved version

Good Luck
